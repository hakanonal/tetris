# AI Agent That Plays Tetris

This repository's goal is to develop and teach an agent that play the tetris game.

## Scope

The project's scope is to: 
- Develop tetris game environment and agent in python
- Plug metric monitoring system using [wandb](https://www.wandb.com)
- Deploy to cloud server.
- Optimize hyperparameters to find best agent.
- Create a presentation that a well trained agent plays tetris game.

## Methodology

- The script development will be kept on a jupyter notebook. It is kept as a journal which consists all resources I have used, thought process, trials, errors, deadlocks etc.... You can find it [here](train.ipynb)
- I will use abstract template that I have used on my previous AI projects.
- When the code is ready to deploy I will convert it to .py script files and deploy to cloud so that I can train longer to find the best agent.
- To find the best agent I will use wandb sweep mechanism which will try all possible hyper-parameters and reports nicely. I will share the link here when the report is ready.
- I will also use [this](https://github.com/hakanonal/tetris/projects/1) project kan-ban board to keep track the progress.
- This is an open-source project so please if you have any contributions from your heart do not hesitate to open an issue.

## Conclusion

Under development. No conclusions yet.
